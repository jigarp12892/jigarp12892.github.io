I am a PhD student in Mechanical and Mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo.

I am trying to improve our understanding of metal additive manufacturing (3D printing) by making sense of the data we collect when a part is being printed. I work in the Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Lab (MSAM) under the guidance of Prof. Mihaela Vlasea.  

[I've adapted this static website after discovering <a href="https://krishnakrao.github.io">Krishna Rao's website</a> and then finding <a href="https://academicpages.github.io">academicpages</a>. I wanted a clean, static website template that I don't have to put much time setting up, and I wanted to be more markdown/html focussed than the clunky, expensive and pop-up ridden wordpress option.]
