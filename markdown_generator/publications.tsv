2016-01-01	Prediction of Material Removal Rate in Die-Sinking Electrical Discharge Machining	Procedia Manufacturing	This paper presents a semi-empirical model which shows the relationship between material removal rate in die-sinking Electrical Discharge Machining and peak current and on-time. Peak current and on-time are considered as two critical factors that affect the material removal rate. 	"Prediction of material removal rate in die-sinking electrical discharge machining
