title: "Using Data Science to Analyze the printability of novel copper powder"
excerpt: "I'm currently working on building a dataset of novel copper print data to predict factors that play a crucial role in its printability. Copper alloys are some of the most challenging materials to print using Laser Powder Bed Fusion, owing to their high reflectivity. I'm attempting collect sensor and machine settings data and build tree based classifiers that can help identify successful print zones"
